  - Fixed a bug that would email anyone of a whisper if they were subscribed to that specific discussion (Thanks to hadfieldn)
  - Fixed the double space before the username in the email
  - Changed from 3-space to tab indentation and some other code organisation changes

2.0
  - Added the option for users to be automatically subscribed to discussions they participate in
  - Added the option for the admin to choose between sending emails as HTML or Plaintext
  - Added optional BBCode support
  - Changed the email format a bit (now that there is a plaintext option I removed the plain URL in the emails)
  - Added a notice reminding people to customize the Notifi settings, now that there are quite a few settings
  - Removed unused definitions
  - Many little code cleanups to make it run faster than it would without them

1.8.2
  - Fixed a bug that caused too many emails to be sent
  - Now requires Vanilla 1.1.5 or higher to work, this makes it run faster for everyone and removes the need for the custom email class
  - Updated code indentation

1.8.1
  - Fixed a bug with the new installer

1.8
  - Rewrote the installer using new logic, so now it should handle upgrading from any version, and cause less
    regular server load because it only needs to ask one question each page load instead of many
  - Added a new admin setting, allow admins to force user notification for all posts. Mostly it's just useful for
    testing. Enabling it disables the Notification options in the Account tab.

1.7.4
  - Fixed some PHP 5.1+ specific errors and warnings
  - Fixed some installer problems. I will still rewrite the install.php file later, though

1.7.3
  - Fixed a bug with Vanilla 1.1.5 that would cause an error message when non-extension emails were sent

1.7.2
  - Fixed a bug that would cause errors if Low-Cal Vanilla had never been installed

1.7.1
  - Now works with, and is optimized for, Low-Cal Vanilla 0.4.3a (Thanks to dinoboff for collaborating)

1.7
  - Added the ability to set global Notifi permissions in the Settings tab
  - Users are no longer notified of post edits, only new posts

1.6.2
  - Added the option for the recipient to copy/paste the URL instead of clicking the link in case their email client
    doesn't allow links
  - Made the email for new discussions different from the new comments email again, only slightly

1.6.1
  - Went back to using the (slightly customized) Lussumo Mailer instead of custom emailing code
  - The email is now always the same, regardless of whether it is a new discussion or not

1.6
  - Emails are now sent in HTML, so now they look a bit nicer and include more information
  - Optimized some parts of the code in order to execute fewer database queries
  - There are now two email templates; one for new discussions and one for new comments in existing discussions
  - The _includes folder has returned

1.5.1:
  - Fixed a critical bug that prevented fresh installs
  - Fixed another bug from the old Notify that sometimes stopped new users from registering with the forum
  - Combined a bunch of functions together to save code space
  - Removed the _includes folder

1.5:
  - Users no longer receive notifications for categories they don't have access to
  - Added an option in the Account tab for users to keep receiving emails regardless of their forum visits
  - Added the comment to the email (Thanks to J. Singh)
  - Corrected the method used to add definitions
  - Fixed the Notification options display so that the AJAXy loading gif displays again
  - Removed some old code that wasn't doing anything
  - Altered some logic to place less load on the server

1.4:
  - Made it possible for forum members to choose to be automatically subscribed to discussions they start
  - Changed the JavaScript so that the options don't disappear when you change them anymore
  - If a user chooses to subscribe to the entire forum, all options that would make that redundant disappear.
    Old settings are still saved in case the user changes their mind
  - Removed some code redundancies
  - Changed various text descriptions to provide clearer/more information

1.3.1:
  - Fixed a bug which could cause the side menu links to not display on comments.php

1.3 (From Notify 1.2.1):
  - Page and comment number is now included in the email link (where before it was just
    comments.php?DiscussionID=20, now it will be comments.php?DiscussionID=20&page5#Item_5, for example)
  - Rewrite of the email text
  - Complete code re-indentation and comments
  - Syntactical changes that may fix bugs some users have reported
